# PROJECT_INDEX Roadmap

## Vision
Transform PROJECT_INDEX from a proof-of-concept into a production-ready, intelligent code navigation and search system that developers use daily.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Basic indexing with function/class extraction
- ‚úÖ Neural embedding support via Ollama
- ‚úÖ Similarity search and clustering
- ‚úÖ Claude Code integration via hooks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sequential processing (slow)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple separate scripts (complex workflow)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Full rebuilds only (no incremental updates)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è JSON storage (performance bottleneck)

## Phase 0: Real-Time Code Intelligence Platform (Week 1)

### üöÄ Complete Claude Code Integration - IMPLEMENTED & TESTED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Real-Time Guardian System** - World's first AI-powered duplicate prevention
  - ‚úÖ Advisory Mode: Non-blocking context injection for Claude's consideration
  - ‚úÖ Blocking Mode: Interactive prompts with 5 decision options
  - ‚úÖ Performance: <100ms similarity checks with local caching
  - ‚úÖ NixOS Support: Auto-detection and `nix run nixpkgs#ollama` integration
  
- [x] **Claude Code Hook Integration** - Production Ready
  - ‚úÖ PreToolUse hooks for Write/Edit/MultiEdit interception
  - ‚úÖ PostToolUse hooks for incremental index updates
  - ‚úÖ UserPromptSubmit hooks for context pre-loading
  - ‚úÖ JSON output format with permission controls
  - ‚úÖ Graceful degradation when Ollama unavailable

### üß† Intelligent Workflow Integration
- [ ] **Learning System** - Adaptive Intelligence
  - Capture user decisions (proceed vs reuse existing)
  - Auto-adjust similarity thresholds based on acceptance rates
  - Team-specific pattern recognition and preferences
  - Context-aware recommendations (test vs production code)

- [ ] **Zero-Configuration Setup**
  - Auto-detect project type and generate appropriate index
  - Smart defaults: Advisory mode, 85% threshold, common patterns
  - Background embedding generation with progress indicators
  - **Target: <5 minutes from install to first value**

### üìä Complete Developer Experience
```bash
# Real workflow example:
Developer writes code ‚Üí Hook intercepts ‚Üí Guardian analyzes ‚Üí 
Context injected ‚Üí Claude makes informed decision ‚Üí Index updated ‚Üí 
System learns from outcome
```

**Success Metrics:** 
- ‚ö° <100ms response time (99th percentile)
